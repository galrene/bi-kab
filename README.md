# Cryptography and Security Bachelor course

## Task2
Find a message with a SHA-512 hash starting with a specified number of leading zeros.

## Task3
Implement functions to encrypt and decrypt a TGA image file, using a block cipher.

## Task4
Implement functions (seal and open) for hybrid encryption using OpenSSL, where seal encrypts data with a symmetric cipher and encrypts the symmetric key with RSA using a public key, and open decrypts data by decrypting the symmetric key with a private key, ensuring successful execution and handling of errors.
